"""
* EXERCISE:
 * - Create examples of basic functions that represent the different
 *   possibilities of the language:
 *   No parameters or return, with one or multiple parameters, with return...
 * - Check if you can create functions inside functions.
 * - Use some examples of functions already created in the language.
 * - Test the concept of LOCAL and GLOBAL variables.
 * - You must print the result of all examples to the console.
 *   (and keep in mind that each language may have more or less possibilities)
 *
 * EXTRA DIFFICULTY (optional):
 * Create a function that takes two string parameters and returns a number.
 * - The function prints all numbers from 1 to 100. Taking into account that:
 *   - If the number is a multiple of 3, it shows the first parameter string.
 *   - If the number is a multiple of 5, it shows the second parameter string.
 *   - If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, it shows both concatenated strings.
 *   - The function returns the number of times the number has been printed instead of the texts.
 *
 * Pay special attention to the syntax you should use in each case.
 * Each language follows conventions that you must respect for the code to be understood.

# Functions allow us to modularize and automate our code. 
# Python provides built-in functions, but we can also create 
# our own functions that are tailored to our specific project.
